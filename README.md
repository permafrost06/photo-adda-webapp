# photo-adda-webapp
An experimental webapp for sharing photos on local network.
I developed it for my photography club's weekly _Photo Adda_ event where photos from multiple devices(laptop/usb drive/smartphones) need to be sent to one device(usually a laptop). While this was never used in that context, it is perfectly functional, albeit lacking in features.
